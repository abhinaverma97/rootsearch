# RootSearch — Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind)

Minimal Next.js app (TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS.

## Quick start

1. cd into the `web/` folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` — you should see a simple dark-grey landing page

Notes:
- This is a very small starter scaffold. You can add an API proxy to the FastAPI backend later (e.g. via `next.config.js` rewrites).
- Install versions are pinned in `package.json`; feel free to upgrade if desired.
